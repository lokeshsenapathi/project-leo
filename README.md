I.	Introduction
In the realm of medical imaging, the early detection of retinal diseases holds immense importance for timely intervention and treatment. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging alongside deep neural networks presents a promising avenue for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This project endeavors to harness the power of deep learning to develop a sophisticated model capable of detecting various retinal diseases from OCT images. Optical Coherence Tomography offers a non-invasive means of obtaining high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina, providing invaluable insights into its structural integrity. With conditions like age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, prompt detection is crucial to prevent irreversible damage and preserve vision.
To tackle the complexity of retinal disease diagnosis, this project employs pre-trained deep neural networks and transfer learning strategies. Leveraging the DenseNet121 model, initially trained on the extensive ImageNet dataset, serves as a robust foundation for this endeavour. By building upon the knowledge acquired during its training on diverse image data, the model can efficiently recognize intricate patterns within OCT images associated with various retinal diseases.
The advantages of utilizing pre-trained models are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the computational burden and time required for training, a critical consideration in medical research where resources are often limited. Additionally, the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of DenseNet121 enable the model to discern both subtle details and overarching patterns within the complex structures of retinal images.
II. Data Analysis

We started by examining the structure and composition of our dataset. It consisted of OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images categorized into four main classes: Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Drusen, and Healthy (NORMAL). We also analyzed the distribution of images across these classes to ensure a balanced representation for effective model learning.

Before feeding the data into our model, we performed preprocessing steps to standardize the images and ensure consistency. This involved converting grayscale images to RGB format, resizing them to a uniform size (224x224 pixels), and normalizing pixel values to a standard range. 
One challenge we encountered was class imbalance, where certain classes had significantly fewer samples compared to others. To address this, we employed techniques like weighted loss functions during training to give more emphasis to underrepresented classes and prevent bias in model predictions.
We divided our dataset into separate sets for training, validation, and testing. The training set was used to train the model, the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and monitor performance, and the test set to evaluate the final model's accuracy and generalization ability. 
To assess the effectiveness of our model, we calculated various performance metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve). These metrics provided insights into the model's ability to correctly classify retinal images across different disease categories while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

ABNORMAL and 2,441 as NORMAL. The Test Set includes 5,467 images, with 2,897 labelled as ABNORMAL and 2,570 as NORMAL.
Data Pre-processing Steps:
Images undergo several pre-processing steps before being fed into the model. Initially, grayscale images are converted to RGB format to ensure consistency. Then, they are resized to 256 pixels using Bilinear interpolation to maintain image quality. A central crop of 224x224 pixels is taken to standardize image dimensions. The images are further converted into Porch tensors for compatibility with the deep learning framework. Finally, normalization is applied using mean and standard deviation values of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and [0.229, 0.224, 0.225] respectively, ensuring consistent pixel intensity values across images.
Hyperparameters Used During Training:
The training process employs specific hyperparameters to optimize model performance. The batch size for training, validation, and testing is set to 512 and 256, respectively. Input images are standardized to a size of (3, 224, 224), representing 3 channels (RGB) and image dimensions of 224x224 pixels. The learning rate is set to 0.01, with a weight decay of 1e-3. Class weights are assigned to handle class imbalance, with values of 0.9436568520537986 for the ABNORMAL class and 1.0634985661614094 for the NORMAL class. The Adam optimizer is utilized, along with a Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss function tailored to account for class imbalance. The model undergoes 5 training epochs, with all feature extraction layers frozen

Description of the Input Features

The input features consist of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images representing retinal tissues. These images capture the structural and morphological characteristics of the retina, with the retinal tissue's structure serving as the signal and any speckle noise present acting as the noise component. To comply with the requirements of the RESNET-18 model, the images are expected to be in RGB format with three channels and resized to dimensions of 224 pixels by 224 pixels. Consequently, the input data is represented as PyTorch tensors with a size of (batch_size, 3, 224, 224), facilitating downstream tasks such as feature extraction and classification.

Description and Interpretation of the Model Output

The model's output is generated by the final layer, producing uninterpretable numerical values known as 'logits'. To make sense of these logits, they are passed through a softmax activation function. Since the final layer comprises two output units corresponding to the two classes (ABNORMAL and NORMAL), the output tensor has a size of [batch size, 2]. For instance, an example output of raw logits may appear as follows: tensor ([[-0.9759, 0.7543]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>). These values become interpretable upon applying the softmax function, yielding probabilities for each class. In the provided example, after softmax, the output tensor becomes tensor([[0.1506, 0.8494]], grad_fn=<SoftmaxBackward0>). The values 0.1506 and 0.8494 represent the 'class probabilities' or 'confidence' of the model in assigning the input image to each respective class. In this scenario, the model assigns the input image to the second class with 84.94% confidence, while the sum of the probabilities always equals 100%.
IV. Model Limitations
The deep learning model, while impressive, has several inherent limitations. Interpretability is lower compared to traditional techniques, making it challenging to understand its decision-making processes and inner workings. Additionally, the model's performance heavily relies on the quality and consistency of the training data labelling and image acquisition process. Inaccurate or inconsistent labelling, as well as variations in image quality, can significantly impact its accuracy and generalization ability.
In addition to these overall limitations, specific considerations regarding precision and recall metrics should be noted. The model tends to exhibit slightly higher recall but relatively lower precision. This indicates a propensity towards over-predicting abnormal cases, potentially to minimize false negatives. However, this inclusivity may result in an increased number of false positives. To achieve a balance between precision and recall for clinical use, adjustments to predicted probability thresholds may be necessary. Fine-tuning these thresholds can optimize the model's performance according to specific diagnostic or treatment requirements.
Recognizing and addressing these limitations is crucial for understanding the model's capabilities and potential constraints in real-world applications. Continued research and development efforts can focus on mitigating these challenges to enhance the model's reliability and utility in clinical settings.
